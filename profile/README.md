## ⚙️ Overview

The **Aim Assist** tool operates as a non-invasive external module that reads real-time frame and input data to deliver smooth crosshair correction. It dynamically adjusts targeting angles based on weapon recoil, player movement, and hitbox proximity — ideal for players seeking balanced, humanized assistance rather than rigid auto-aiming.

[!IMPORTANT]

> The Delta Force Aim Assist uses pixel scanning and motion interpolation only — no internal injection or memory edits. 100% safe for local and offline play.

## 🧠 Core Features

* **🎯 Adaptive Aim Curve:** Automatically aligns reticle motion to moving targets.
* **💥 Recoil Normalization:** Compensates vertically and horizontally for each weapon.
* **🧩 Dynamic Sensitivity Sync:** Matches DPI scaling across scoped and unscoped modes.
* **🔭 Crosshair Overlay:** Customizable reticle color, thickness, and lock radius.
* **🕹 Smart Target Prioritization:** Focuses nearest visible enemy within FOV range.
* **📈 Precision Graphs:** Displays assist behavior and aim smoothness curves live.

Example Config:

```ini
[AIM_ASSIST]
SensitivityMultiplier=1.25
FOV=90
LockStrength=0.7
RecoilCompX=0.15
RecoilCompY=0.25
EnableCrosshair=True
```

[!NOTE]

> Adjust values carefully to maintain natural movement and avoid overcorrection.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Download** and extract the latest verified build.
2. **Launch** `DeltaForce_AimAssist.exe` before starting the game.
3. **Select your sensitivity preset** (Low, Medium, High DPI).
4. **Press F1** to enable assist mode.
5. **Tune settings** in real-time using the overlay interface.

Command Example:

```bash
DeltaForce_AimAssist.exe /config="competitive_mode.ini"
```

[!WARNING]

> Avoid toggling assist on/off too frequently mid-match — recalibration requires 3–4 frames to re-sync.
